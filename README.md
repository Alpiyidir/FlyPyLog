# FlyPyLog
A desktop application written in Python that has a fully functional gui. I started writing the program with a friend of mine and he helped me with part of the first gui window functionality. The program allows for the creating of flight logs that store departure and destination airportsâ€™ icao codes and a log file written by the user. While displaying the log file users are able to see the distance between the two airports in nautical miles or kilometers (chosen via a radio button). This is accomplished by using a local sqlite3 database that holds the longitude and latitude of nearly every airport in the world along with their icao codes. This dataset was collected from the official icao database. This program is my first independent project (excluding small initial collaboration with my friend DemirJoe who could later on due to academic workload not help me with the project)
